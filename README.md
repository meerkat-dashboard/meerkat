# Meerkat

![pkgsite](https://pkg.go.dev/badge/github.com/meerkat-dashboard/meerkat "link to Go doc")

Meerkat is a utility to create and share dashboards for Icinga 2 checks and hosts. It is comprised of a lightweight Go server and a browser front-end written in Preact. It's quick to setup and easy to use.

**Not developing Meerkat?** See the Meerkat website at https://meerkat.run

## Development

Meerkat development requires supported releases of Go and Node.js.
See the [Go installation][goinstall] and [Node.js install][nodeinstall] documentation.
Devolopment with older toolchains may be ok but we can't guarantee the behaviour.

### Quickstart

A typical workflow involves starting a filesystem watcher to rebuild the UI on changes:

	cd ui
	npx webpack --mode development --watch

Then run another command to start meerkat with `go run`:

	go run ./cmd/meerkat -ui ui

The ui flag sets meerkat to serve the UI bundle from the ui directory.
This means subsequent changes to the UI will be served without
requiring a rebuild of the entire command.

For more detail on each stage, keep reading.

### Development workflow

Another workflow involves running local test suites,
then building and running the program for manual testing.

As before, start by installing javascript dependencies:

	cd ui
	npm install

Throughout development, tests can be run via `go test`.
This includes Javascript tests.
To run all tests:

	go test ./...

Finally, build the UI and the server and run the command:

	cd ui
	npm run build
	cd ../cmd/meerkat
	go build
	./meerkat

For command usage, see [cmd/meerkat].
For a configuration file reference, see [Configuration].

## Configuring Icinga

Meerkat communicates with Icinga via its HTTP API.
This requires authentication.
Here is an example `ApiUser` object with limited, read-only privileges:

	object ApiUser "meerkat" {
		password = "meerkat"
		permissions = [ "objects/query/Host", "objects/query/Service", "objects/query/ServiceGroup", "objects/query/HostGroup" ]
	}

In a default Icinga2 installation, you can write this definition to `/etc/icinga2/conf.d/api-users.conf`.
