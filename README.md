# Meerkat

![pkgsite](https://pkg.go.dev/badge/github.com/meerkat-dashboard/meerkat)

Meerkat is a utility to create and share dashboards for Icinga 2 checks and hosts. It is comprised of a lightweight Go server and a browser front-end written in Preact. It's quick to setup and easy to use.

**Not developing Meerkat?** See the Meerkat website at https://meerkat.run
## Getting started
To install and setup Meerkat locally follow these steps.
### Installation
1. Download the installation script and make executable.
```sh
cd /tmp
wget https://github.com/meerkat-dashboard/meerkat/blob/main/contrib/download-install-latest-release.sh
chmod +x download-install-latest-release.sh
```
2. Run setup script.
```sh
Usage: download-install-latest-release.sh --port PORT --user USER [--label LABEL] [--cert-name CERT_NAME] [--release-url RELEASE_URL]
  --user        User for the meerkat instance
  --port        Port for the meerkat instance
  --label       Unique label for the meerkat instance under /usr/local/meerkat
  --cert-name   Name for the SSL certificate
  --release-url URL of the meerkat release to download from GitHub
```
##### Standard installation
```sh
sudo ./download-install-latest-release.sh --port 8080 --user meerkat
```

##### Multiple Meerkat installation
The below would install meerkat to different directories and run it on different ports.
```sh
sudo ./download-install-latest-release.sh --port 8080 --user meerkat --label foo
sudo ./download-install-latest-release.sh --port 8081 --user meerkat --label bar
```
These will have different configuration files, install directories and service name based on the label.
Service Name: `meerkat-foo`, `meerkat-bar`
Config: `/etc/meerkat-foo.toml`, `/etc/meerkat-bar.toml`
Install Directory: `/usr/local/meerkat-foo/`, `/usr/local/meerkat-bar/`

### Configuration
To configure Meerkat you must edit the `meerkat.toml` config file (Default location is `/etc/meerkat.toml`)

```
# The address, in host:port format, to serve meerkat from. For example 0.0.0.0:8080. 
# The default is “:8080” i.e. all IPv4, IPv6 addresses port 8080.
HTTPAddr = "0.0.0.0:8080"

# The URL for an instance of Icinga serving the Icinga API
IcingaURL = "https://127.0.0.1:5665"

# The username and password with which to authenticate to Icinga. 
# Normally set in /etc/icinga2/conf.d/api-users.conf on your Icinga2 master.
IcingaUsername = "meerkat"
IcingaPassword = "YOUR SECURE PASSWORD HERE"

# If IcingaInsecureTLS to true, verification of the TLS certificates served by the Icinga API is skipped. 
# This is usually required when Icinga is configured with self-signed certificates.
#IcingaInsecureTLS = true

# If SSLEnable to true, meerkat will serve data over http2 using the crt and key.
# A ssl cert and key is required if you enable ssl.
# This option is required for multiple dashboards to function, Meerkat uses eventstreams which are limited in http1, http2 has a higher limit.
SSLEnable = true
SSLCert = ""
SSLKey = ""

# If LogFile is true, meerkat will log to file.
LogFile = true
# If LogConsole is true, meerkat will log to console.
LogConsole = false
# Path to folder to store log files. 
LogDirectory = "log/"

# If IcingaDebug set to true meerkat will output icinga api debug information.
IcingaDebug = false
```

## Development

Meerkat development requires supported releases of Go and Node.js.
See the [Go installation][goinstall] and [Node.js install][nodeinstall] documentation.
Devolopment with older toolchains may be ok but we can't guarantee the behaviour.

### Quickstart

A typical workflow involves starting a filesystem watcher to rebuild the UI on changes:

	cd ui
	npm run dev

Then run another command to start meerkat with `go run`:

	go run ./cmd/meerkat -ui ui

The ui flag sets meerkat to serve the UI bundle from the ui directory.
This means subsequent changes to the UI will be served without
requiring a rebuild of the entire command.

For more detail on each stage, keep reading.

### Development workflow

Another workflow involves running local test suites,
then building and running the program for manual testing.

As before, start by installing javascript dependencies:

	cd ui
	npm ci

Throughout development, tests can be run via `go test`.
This includes Javascript tests.
To run all tests:

	go test ./...

Finally, build the UI and the server and run meerkat:

	cd ui
	npm run build
	cd ../cmd/meerkat
	go build
	./meerkat

By default, meerkat listens on the address http://127.0.0.1:8080.
Open meerkat and have a click around!

For command usage, see [cmd/meerkat].
For a configuration file reference, see [Configuration].

### Contributing

#### Test

Before submitting a change, ensure code is formatted:

	go fmt
	cd ui
	npm run lint

Run all the tests from the root of the project:

	go test ./...

#### Commit message

Commit messages follow the same format used by the [Go] project (among others).
The commit subject starts with the affected package name then a brief description of the change.
The body may contain an explanation of the change and why it was made.
See commit 4603601 for an example.

## Configuring Icinga

Meerkat communicates with Icinga via its HTTP API.
This requires authentication.
Here is an example `ApiUser` object with limited, read-only privileges:

	object ApiUser "meerkat" {
		password = "meerkat"
		permissions = [ "objects/query/Host", "objects/query/Service", "objects/query/ServiceGroup", "objects/query/HostGroup", "events/StateChange" , "events/CheckResult", "status/query" ]
	}

In a default Icinga2 installation, you can write this definition to `/etc/icinga2/conf.d/api-users.conf`.
