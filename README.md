# Meerkat

Meerkat is a utility to create and share dashboards for Icinga 2 checks and hosts. It is comprised of a lightweight Go server and a browser front-end written in Preact. It's quick to setup and easy to use.

**Not developing Meerkat?** See the Meerkat website at https://meerkat.run

## Development

First, build the frontend. Install dependencies, then build the application bundle:

	cd frontend
	npm install
	npm run build

Next, build the backend.
The meerkat executable serves the frontend bundle from "frontend" directory,
so write the binary to the repository root:

	cd backend
	go build -o ..

Finally, run meerkat and provide a configuration file:

	cd ..
	./meerkat -config config/meerkat.toml

Or on Windows

	cd ..
	.\meerkat.exe -config config\meerkat.toml

See `config/meerkat.toml.example` for an example configuration file.
For a full configuration reference, see [Configuration](https://meerkat.run/configuration) on the project website.

## Configuring Icinga

Meerkat communicates with Icinga via its HTTP API.
This requires authentication.
Here is an example `ApiUser` object with limited, read-only privileges:

	object ApiUser "meerkat" {
		password = "meerkat"
		permissions = [ "objects/query/Host", "objects/query/Service", "objects/query/ServiceGroup", "objects/query/HostGroup" ]
	}

In a default Icinga2 installation, you can write this definition to `/etc/icinga2/conf.d/api-users.conf`.
